# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2026-01-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by Michael Nygard in his article "Documenting Architecture Decisions".

ADRs will be stored in `docs/adr/` with the naming convention `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`.

## Consequences

- All significant architectural decisions will be documented
- New team members can understand why decisions were made
- We can revisit decisions with full context
- Decisions are versioned alongside the code
